            "[\"Now, let's take a closer look at how smart contracts work within DeFi.\", 'As we mentioned earlier, smart contracts are like self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into the code.', 'They can hold cryptocurrency assets, send them from one entity to another, and even enforce the rules of the transaction.', 'This is a major improvement over traditional contracts, which often rely on intermediaries like lawyers and notaries to verify the terms and conditions.', 'One of the key benefits of smart contracts is their transparency.', \"Because they're built on a blockchain, all the terms and conditions of the contract are transparent and available for anyone to see.\", 'This not only increases trust and confidence in the contract but also reduces the risk of disputes and misunderstandings.', 'In addition to smart contracts, DeFi is also closely associated with decentralized apps (dApps) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).', 'These platforms operate to help connect and enable individuals looking to execute cryptocurrency transactions.', \"They're like online marketplaces, but instead of buying and selling goods, you're buying and selling cryptocurrencies.\", 'Now, you might be thinking, \"This all sounds great, but what about my money? Who has custody of it?\"', 'Well, with DeFi, you do.', 'You have control over your own cryptocurrency assets, and you can use them to make transactions directly with others.', 'This is a huge shift in power and control, from the centralized authorities to the individual users.']\n",
