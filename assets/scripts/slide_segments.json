      "narration_script": "Let's start with the public blockchain. A public blockchain is a permissionless distributed ledger where anyone can join and conduct transactions. It's a non-restrictive form of the ledger in which each peer has a copy. This means that anyone with an internet connection can access the public blockchain. They have access to historical and contemporary records, and they can even perform mining operations. However, public blockchain also has some disadvantages. One of the biggest disadvantages is that it has lower transactions per second (TPS). This is because it's a large network with many nodes, and it takes time to verify a transaction and perform the proof-of-work procedure.",

Blockchain networks are not just about storing data, they're about creating a secure, transparent, and decentralized way of conducting transactions. But how do we design a network architecture that supports these applications and protocols? That's what we're going to explore in this video. So, let's start with the basics. Blockchain network architecture can be broken down into three main layers: the application layer, the protocol layer, and the infrastructure layer. Think of it like a layered cake. Each layer plays a crucial role in making the blockchain network function smoothly.",

This is where end-users interact with the blockchain network through various applications such as wallets, smart contracts, or decentralized apps (dapps). It's the interface between the user and the blockchain. But how does the application layer communicate with the rest of the network? That's where the protocol layer comes in. The protocol layer defines the core logic and rules of the blockchain network, including the consensus algorithm, cryptography, data structure, and network protocol. It's the set of instructions that govern how the network behaves. And finally, we have the infrastructure layer. This is responsible for deploying and managing the physical and virtual resources that support the blockchain network. Think of it like the backbone of the network. It includes nodes, servers, cloud services, and network devices.",

      "narration_script": "but how does it all work? at the heart of the cryptocurrency system is something called the blockchain. it's like a digital ledger that records every single transaction that's ever taken place, and it's maintained by a network of computers rather than a central authority. this means that every single transaction is transparent and can be viewed by anyone, but it also means that the records are secure and can't be altered or deleted. now, you might be wondering how these transactions are verified and added to the blockchain. this is where cryptocurrency mining comes in. mining is the process by which new cryptocurrency is created and transactions are verified. it's a complex process that involves solving complex mathematical problems, and it requires a lot of processing power. there are two main consensus mechanisms used to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain: proof of work and proof of stake. proof of work is used by bitcoin and requires high-powered computers and a large amount of processing power. it's a bit like a digital lottery, where miners around the world compete to solve a complex mathematical problem. the miner who solves the problem first gets to update the blockchain and receive new cryptocurrency. proof of stake, on the other hand, is used by ethereum and employs a network of validators who \"stake\" their own cryptocurrency for a chance to validate the next transaction. it's a more energy-efficient system that rewards validators based on their stake, rather than the processing power of their computers.",

Well, smart contract programming can also refer to dapp development that involves interaction with smart contracts. This might include using web3 js call contract function or listening to smart contract events using ethers.js. But here's the thing - technically speaking, you're not coding smart contracts in those cases. Instead, you're just interacting with already deployed contracts, listening to their events, and triggering web3 contract methods.",

By understanding use cases, developers can refine how users interact with a platform or program. Use cases typically include information about who's using the software, the user's goal, the steps the user takes to complete a task, and how the software reacts to the user's actions. They're a crucial tool for software development and design, helping developers create the best possible outcome scenario and lead problem-solving sessions.",
